# Tourism & Culture Guide RAG Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that answers tourism-related questions using curated data from Wikipedia (via scraping), tourism PDFs, and text sources. 
Built with Python, LangChain, FAISS, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash.

# Features

Fetches tourism and cultural data from:

    Wikipedia articles

    Tourism brochures (PDF)

    Plain text URLs

Chunks and embeds documents using FAISS

Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM for generating context-aware answers

Supports multiple cities in one searchable index

Can run entirely locally (LLM call still requires internet)

# Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

8GB+ RAM (Recommended: 16GB)

Google Gemini API key

# Installation


git clone https://github.com/ktj709/Tourism-Culture-Guide---RAG-Chatbot
cd Tourism-Culture-Guide---RAG-Chatbot

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory:

     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here


# Running the Project

python main.py

# Once running, type your tourism question, e.g.:

"Best cultural festivals in Jaipur"

"Top 3 museums in Mumbai"

"Traditional food to try in Delhi"

# Adding New Cities

Edit the cities list in main.py:
     for example:

       cities = [
    {
        "name": "Paris",
        "wiki": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris",
        "pdf": ["any pdf having relevant data.pdf"],
        "text_url": None
    }
    ]


# Some important points

Current Cities: The dataset currently includes only Delhi, Mumbai, and Jaipur.

      Easy Expansion: Adding more cities is simple:

        Add the new city’s details in the cities list in main.py.

        Provide the city name, a valid Wikipedia link (optional), and at least one tourism-related PDF containing relevant data about that city.

        Run the ingestion pipeline again to rebuild the FAISS index.

        Document Sources: The RAG pipeline supports PDFs, Wikipedia articles, and plain-text URLs.

        Custom Data: You can mix and match multiple data sources per city — the retrieval system will merge them into one searchable index.
